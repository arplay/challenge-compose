        "Mr. Nacho is our longest rescue resident and he has been patiently waiting for his forever home since September 2019. Nacho is a sweet 60 lb male bully breed mix from Kauai. He’s about 7 years old, affectionate, and loves to cuddle with his foster family. He's had full obedience training and has excellent leash manners but does require a skilled handler who can provide good leadership. He is currently being fostered with a trainer and his adoption will include two take home lessons. While on leash he can be extremely excitable, but with proper handling he will heel politely by your side. He is crate trained and loves to fetch. Nacho’s ideal home will be with a dog-savvy couple or family in a single-family residence outside the city with a securely fenced yard (no apartments), no pets, and no children under the age of 12. "

Beans is all about that ball life, so if you are looking for a dog that loves fetch he's your guy! His DNA is 50% AmStaff, 20% Aussie Shepherd, 20% Collie so it's no surprise he can hang with the athletes, but he also has a sweet and sensitive side and is happy to snuggle up and snore the afternoon away. Beans is incredibly food motivated and eager to please! He is crate trained, but does have some minor separation anxiety that presents in the form of whining, not barking. Beans is also house trained, and does well on leash with a training collar. Beans does have some leash reactivity, but he has drastically improved that behavior and with continued training we are confident he will be an excellent canine citizen.  "

        "Toby is a 5-year-old medium mixed breed (such a soft coat!) who is a great size at 35 lbs. He can be a little shy around new people, but he's very sweet and gentle once he warms up to you. Toby is crate trained and house trained, and is learning things like sit, stay, place, crate, and more in his Seattle-area foster home. His leash manners are improving and he's a great running partner, but he needs work on his leash reactivity around other dogs and small furries. Toby will benefit from slow introductions to other dogs, and does best with dogs that are bigger than he is. Once he's comfortable with other dogs, hanging out with them helps him become more confident. Toby does have some prey drive, so a home without cats or other small pets is needed. We are only considering single family residence's for Toby at this time. This sweet pup is ready for his forever home, where he can explore the world in good company and have a loving family to cuddle up with. We'll post more information about him as we get to know him better. "
